Now we will rewrite the LED blink example in a more structured way later in this tutorial.
CH559 has 45 I/O pins, some of them have alternative functions. All the GPIOs are group into ports of up to 8 pins. P0 to P3 all registers for the GPIO are bit addressable.</description></item><item><title>CH559 Programming (Part 4): Using UART</title><link>https://kprasadvnsi.com/posts/bare-metal-ch559-pt4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kprasadvnsi.com/posts/bare-metal-ch559-pt4/</guid><description>After toggling some I/O pins, the first thing you should get up and running on a new platform is UART. CH559 chip provides two full-duplex asynchronous serial ports: UART0 and UART1. UART0 is a standard MCS51 serial port, and UART1 is an enhanced asynchronous serial port with a lot of features that we talk about in future tutorials.
We need the datasheet for register definitions. WCH only provides Datasheet in Chinese.</description></item></channel></rss>
